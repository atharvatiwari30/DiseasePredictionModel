# Disease Prediction from Symptoms

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms.

## Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Datasets Used

### Source-1: Kaggle Dataset

The dataset used in `main.py` can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning).

- **Dataset Details:**
  - Total Columns: 133
  - Symptoms Columns: 132 symptoms experienced by patients
  - Target Column: Prognosis (disease prediction)

### Source-2: Columbia University Dataset

The dataset used in the Jupyter notebook (`Disease-Prediction-from-Symptoms-checkpoint.ipynb`) can be downloaded from [Columbia University](https://impact.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html).

- **Dataset Details:**
  - Columns:
    - Disease
    - Count of Disease Occurrence
    - Symptom

You can either copy-paste the data into an Excel sheet or scrape it using Beautifulsoup.
